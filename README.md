Napoleon’s March - Visualization Clone Using Shiny

Features
Interactive Maps: Visualize the advance and retreat of Napoleon’s army using polyline paths.
City Markers: Mark cities along the route with survival counts.
Temperature Overlay: View weather data along the journey with colored markers indicating temperature levels.
Interactive Timeline Slider: Control the progression of the campaign and see how troop sizes changed over time.
Insightful Descriptions: Explore background information and data for each phase of the campaign.


Project Structure
Iteration 1
Visualizes the advance (red) and retreat (black) routes using polylines.
Line thickness reflects the number of troops at different points.

Iteration 2
Adds circle markers to indicate cities and the number of surviving troops during the campaign.
Red markers represent cities visited during the advance and black markers during the retreat.

Iteration 3
Introduces a temperature overlay showing the impact of the Russian winter using a color-coded scale:
White: 0°C
Light Blue: -5°C to -10°C
Blue: -11°C to -20°C
Dark Blue: Below -21°C

Iteration 4
Implements an interactive timeline slider to animate the troop movements over time.
Users can track the campaign phases month by month with dynamic troop counts and weather markers.

Technologies Used
R programming language
Shiny: For building the interactive web app
Leaflet: For rendering interactive maps
Dplyr: For data manipulation
Readr: For reading datasets
